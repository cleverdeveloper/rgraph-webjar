# RGraph for WebJars

[RGraph](http://www.rgraph.net/) ([website](http://www.rgraph.net/))
was released under the MIT license.

It looks like starting with version 4 the library is not distributed under MIT
license anymore. The last known MIT license version is 3_2014-07-27-stable
therefore.

The license is not revocable, so you should be able to continue using it without
any issues unless you upgrade. This also includes changing the code and doing
whatever MIT license permits you.
